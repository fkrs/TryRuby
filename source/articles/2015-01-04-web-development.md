## Web development
One of the areas of software development where Ruby really shines is web development. From creating
a simple website to a full cloud based webservice, it is all easily attainable.

### Ruby-on-rails
I should mention Ruby on Rails. You have been learning the Ruby language, how to speak it.
But Rails is a very powerful and popular toolkit for building websites.

Ruby-on-rails, or RoR, consists of set of Ruby libraries. These libraries help you do things that
websites commonly need. Like routing an incoming request to the correct handler. Or interacting with
the database. Or returning a fully rendered webpage.

RoR makes creating a website easy, __if__ you follow the RoR conventions. This also means that you
do not have to setup a lot of complicated stuff in order to get RoR to work.
RoR people call this principle _convention over configuration_.

One important convention is called: _Model-View-Controller_ (for purists it is a design pattern). It means that you should separate code
for: business logic (the model), rendering webpages (the view) and connecting stuff (the
controller).

If you're interested in learning about Rails, I would
<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">head over there</a>
right away. Start using your Ruby skills proper!

### Other frameworks
One disadvantage of RoR is that, because there are so many libraries and conventions, it takes
a while to learn RoR.

There are several other Ruby web frameworks that are simpler and easier to learn:

- __Sinatra__  
  Popular: <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra</a>
- __Camping__  
  Originally crafted by \_why (just like this website): <a href="http://camping.io/" target="_blank">Camping</a>
- __Grape__  
  Handy for creating webservices: <a href="http://intridea.github.io/grape/" target="_blank">Grape</a>
- __Ramaze__  
  Simple and few conventions: <a href="http://ramaze.net/" target="_blank">Ramaze</a>
- __NyNy__  
  Very simple, but extendable: <a href="http://alisnic.github.io/nyny/" target="_blank">NyNy</a>

This is just a short list of all frameworks that are available. Some searching should give you
many more options.
